# Project Overview
This project provides information about crimes that occur in the city of Seattle. The purpose of this project is to allow people
to see and compare areas within the city based on how many crimes occur in the area, as well as be able to visualize where they occur,
and finally be able to relatively rank neighborhoods in the city based on certain metrics. Since safety is a very important concern for
the residents of this city, which includes a lot of expats, we believe that it is crucial for people to know about the history of crimes
that take place around them.

## Audience
While anyone can gain insight from this project, our intended audience is the residents of Seattle. Safety is a crucial need for anyone living
in the city and we aim to provide visualizations for them to be able to see what is happening around them.

## Data
The data we use comes from the government of Seattle and includes information about the types of crimes, location and time, as well as other jargon
used by police. The data used for the map comes from an open source which uses the data from Seattle police and adds other information to it.
The data can be found [here.](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Data/4fs7-3vj5)

## Structure
The tab following the overview includes a histogram that displays all the crimes and their frequency in a chosen precinct. The next one creates a map
of a certain type of crime that can be picked. Finally, the last tab allows one to relatively rank neighborhoods based on three different metrics.

## Analysis
With our data we aim to see:
1. Where crimes occur most frequently?
2. See which area of Seattle has the most criminal activity?
3. Be able to relatively rank areas based purely on data in order to avoid bias.
